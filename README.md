# Foodie

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/foodie`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/foodswiper` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'foodie'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install foodie

## Usage

FoodSwiper is the tinder of eating.  No more reading and searching through dozens of restaurants to decide what to eat.  Let your eyes and stomach speak for themselves.  You can swipes hundreds of photos from restaurants in your neighborhood or city in minutes.  See what you crave before you even know it.  All your swipes are saved and you can view them anytime.  

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
